    "topic": None,
    "relevance_assessment": "No. The study examines the brick industry in Bogotá (1910-1940), including the introduction of modern, coal-fired ovens and salaried labor alongside traditional artisanal production[cite: 4, 12]. However, it explicitly states that the modern factories did *not* displace artisanal production during the study period[cite: 5, 13, 21, 283]. The focus is on the coexistence of technologies and their link to urbanization, rather than on empirical evidence of job displacement, unemployment, or underemployment caused by the new technology. Therefore, it does not meet the review's core criterion of examining labor displacement.",
